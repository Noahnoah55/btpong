Multiplayer pong game made in MIT app inventor

This project was a final for me and a partner in our highschool Computer Science class.
I used it to explore the bluetooth features of MIT AppInventor, which the class never touched on.

This game was designed with two identical Android tablets in mind, as those were the only devices my group had on hand.
It also assumes both players are visible through bluetooth, and that only two players are playing at the same time.
